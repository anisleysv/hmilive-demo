# DemoHMI + DemoServerConnect

This repository contains **two demo servers** required to test the ILive mobile app without connecting to a real HMI:

- **DemoHMI** – Simulates live tag readings as if they were coming from an OPC UA server.
- **DemoServerConnect** – Acts as an intermediary between the mobile app and the DemoHMI server (handles discovery, QR, and other support functions).

> ⚠️ Both servers must be running at the same time.  
> The startup order does **not** matter.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18 or later (LTS recommended)  
- **npm** 9 or later  
- Both the **computer** and **mobile device** must be on the **same local network**.

---

## 1) DemoHMI

1. Navigate into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd DemoHMI
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start

The server runs by default on http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 2) DemoServerConnect

1. Navigate into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd DemoServerConnect
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start

The server runs by default on the IP assigned by the local network. The terminal will display a QR code (to be scanned by the mobile app) and the network IP address (to be automatically discovered by the mobile app).
 http://<NETWORK_IP>:3000

## 3) Run Both Demos
Make sure the servers are running on different terminals.

## 4) Test with the ILive Mobile App
  1. Make sure both servers are running on your computer.
  2. Connect your mobile device to the same Wi-Fi network.
  3. Open the ILive mobile app and:
     - Scan the QR code generated by DemoServerConnect, or
     - Use the discovery function to find the available servers on the network.
  4. Once connected, you should see live tag updates coming from DemoHMI

## 5) Common Issues

### ❌ The app doesn’t discover the server
- Make sure both the **PC** and **mobile device** are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.  
- Check that your **firewall** allows incoming connections on ports **3000** and **5000**.  
- Some routers block LAN broadcast or discovery; in that case, open the **QR code** page.
